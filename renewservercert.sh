# Renew a server certificate
# Note: There is no such thing as an "openssl renew". Essentially a completely fresh certificate is created and
#       signed. The only difference to "generateservercert" is that the server private key is reused.
#       If you get an error about duplicate certificates, then delete the file "index.txt.attr" in the
#       "issuingca" directory.

# exit when any command fails
set -e

# Import the variables and change into CA directory
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
cd $DIR
source ./variables.sh

# Check if an argument has been provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
